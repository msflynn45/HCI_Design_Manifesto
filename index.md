## Welcome to Meghan's Design Manifesto

  Over the course of the CS 3433, we have explored many aspects of the user based design process. Here is a reflection/complilation of the projects I have completed overall. The reflection begins with short reflections on the individual assignments.

  2. Design for Others 
  3. Design for Understanding

#Design Reflection 
  Over the course of this term, I found that as a designer, I followed similar steps when approaching each individual problem. After the first project, I tried to approach each assignment with trying to think of who would be the person who would be using the feature. This became more difficult with later projects, but definately made the design decision making process easier once it was determined. 

#Project Reviews 
##Good Design, Bad Design 
  Although this technically was not one of our "main" projects, I think this allowed me some of the most opportunities to learn about design in more general terms. We did a heavy amount of reading in regards to what makes good design but this medium write up was actually focused specifically on what is and is not good design. One of the biggest findings that I got from this exercise overall didn't come from the write up beforehand but actually in the discussion that we had in class after. In that discussion I realized that although there are some "universal bad design choices", things that the whole class whole-heartily agreed was bad, but many people had variying opinions on most of the choices that WPI made.

##Design for Others 
(Designed for K-12 Teachers) 

  Designing for others was one of my favorite projects that we did in this class. The main reason for this was I feel like I learned the most about design. I found it really interesting that although we were all redesigning many of the same websites, the user that we were attempting to design for actually changed the design themselves drastically.

##Design for Understanding 
(Designed for College students deciding if they were changing their major)

  Design for understanding was one of the more challenging assignments. Persuasive design was a topic that I found to be very interesting. The idea that even if we all were designing from the same data, we could have created completely different designs based on what we were trying to accomplish. My group for this project was fantastic and it was easy to decide which dataset we wanted to use, and then from there, what we wanted to accomplish from the project. If I were to do this project again, I wish that everyone would have been challenged to design from the same dataset. 
  
   I have no medium post due to a family emergency. 

##Design for Tension
(Designed for people who know nothing about AI) 
  
  We designed this chatbot (a form of artificial intellegence) to talk to an individual who knew nothing about AI. We wanted to pick a topic that had some controversy, but that we could all talk about in great detail. I think the biggest challenge of this project was the technical limitations. Flow XO, the software that we used, made it difficult to have multiple people working on the chatbot at the same time. This meant that the team spent a while designing the chatbot, but one person had to actually implement it. I think that I were to do this project again, I would have probably just had each person do a smaller chatbot, because it wasn't fair to the one person that got stuck with implementation. Or, I would have just had the project stop at the design phase.

##Design for Wellbeing
(Designed for musicians who are angry or upset)

  The purpose of our design was to create a music recommendation service that suggested music based on an individual's mood. Since music can be pretty subjective, finding music that changed someone's mood became a huge challenge. That being said, I think this was one of the coolest projects that we did, and honestly I would have liked to spend two weeks working on this because I think it had the potential to be really cool and maybe even help people.

##Design for Another World 
(Designed for Job Recruiters) 
  
  Honestly, this project felt very "flashy tech" and I didn't really see much value in that. I'm graduating soon and the liklihood of using VR in my job is not high. Although it was cool, I would have much rather spent the time building up my skills in one of the other design elements. We actually had this discussion as a group, which is why we created a virtual resume. We wanted something that we could theoretically use, even if it was cumbersome.

##Overall Reflection
  How has this term impacted your design philosophy overall? 
  
  The biggest thing that this course has done overall for my design philosophy is the idea that all design is for others. Currently, I'm in the middle of my MQP doing App development. Our client is a network of doctors, and for a majority of this project we were designing for what we thought would be the best. It wasn't until we got deep in the user testing phase that we realized that our application was well designed for college students working an MQP, but was not designed for the actual doctors who would be using it. Some choices that we made because it seemed like the "obvious choice", were actually not intuitive to the doctors who would be actively using the application. Now, after a term of development, we are much closer to a product that was designed with doctors in mind.
